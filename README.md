# Astra-demo-logistics

# Pre-requisites

You need to sign-up to (Astra)[astra.datastax.com]. With that you will have your organization ID.

You will also need a token with permissions to create all the resources.

## Setup Terraform

Follow thw instructions at: https://www.datastax.com/blog/let-s-get-started-with-terraform-for-astra-db

# Run Terraform to provision environment

To provision the database and streaming tenant, you can use terraform.

Create a file to set the variables at the terraform folder with the following content.

E.g.: terraform/myenv.tfvars.json

````
{
    "ASTRA_ORG_ID": "<Your Org ID>",
    "ASTRA_TOKEN": "<Your Astra Token>"
}
````

Validate the terraform script with the planning option

`````
terraform plan  -var-file="myenv.tfvars.json"
`````

If everything runs fine, you can apply the script to provision the environment

`````
terraform apply  -var-file="myenv.tfvars.json"
`````

Some important outputs from the terraform execution are important to set the environment variables in the next step.

# Set Environment Variables

Copy the .env_sample to .env and define your local variables


# Run Docker Containers

At the project root folder, run:

```

docker-compose up

```

# Producer

All the messages can be triggered via APIs.

- GET /ping
  - Endpoint to troubleshoot communication with the backend. If it responds, communictaion is ok
- GET /files
  - Returns all files uplaoded and available at the tmp folder to be produced
- POST /upload
  - Upload multiple files to be produced
- DELETE /files
  - Delete all the files in the tmp folder.
- POST /produce
  - Starts the producers for all files. Messages are sent with a 3 second interval.
- POST /produce-file
  - Start the producer for the specified file

> You can import the file "DataStax Logistics Demo.postman_collection.json" in Postman to interact with the backend

### Attention

Once the producer is triggered, it is not possible to stop it. If needed, stop the container and then clean the data.

## How to generate path files

- Go to the url https://www.keene.edu/campus/maps/tool/[https://www.keene.edu/campus/maps/tool/] and create a path.

- Copy the lat-long part separated by comma to a file with the following pattern <organization_id>-<device-id>-<data_or_key>.txt

- The producer will send a line every 3 seconds with the current timestamp.
